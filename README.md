#          Python Beginner Note

# Introduction
Welcome! This repository is a carefully curated set of notes that I have used to teach myself the Python programming language. The purpose of this repository is to guide learners from novice to expert in Python programming

As a learner, a hobbyist, or a budding developer, these notes will explain complex notions in simple terms that are 'human-readable'. There will be no 'tech speak', no 'filler', just the very foundation upon which one can start creating projects of one’s own.
## 💡Tips :
Don't try to memorize everything. Coding is an open-book skill. Even professional developers Google how to do basic things every single day. Understand the logic, not the syntax.

# What is Python?

Python is a **programming language** used to give instructions to a computer. These instructions can be simple, like printing text on the screen, or complex, like building websites, analyzing data, or training AI models.


## Why Python is Popular

Python is known for:

- **Simple syntax:** Easy to read and write.
- **Clear structure:** Organizes code in a logical way.
- **Large community support:** Tons of tutorials, libraries, and forums.
- **High-level language:** Lets you focus on problem-solving instead of low-level details like memory management.


## High-Level Language

Being a high-level language means Python **hides low-level details** such as memory allocation and hardware control. You don’t need to worry about how the computer stores data—Python handles it for you—so you can focus on the **logic of your program**.

## Interpreted Language

Python is an **interpreted language**, meaning code is executed **line by line** by the Python interpreter.  

Benefits of this:

- Errors are easier to identify
- Testing code is faster
- You can run code interactively in a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

---
# History and Evolution of Python

Python was developed in the **late 1980s** by **Guido van Rossum** at **CWI (Netherlands)** and was officially released in **1991**. The language was inspired by:
- The teaching language **ABC**
- The comedy show *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*

### Major Python Versions

- **Python 1.0 (1994):** Introduced core features, including class support.
- **Python 2.0 (2000):** Added major improvements and broader library support.
- **Python 3.0 (2008):** A major redesign focused on consistency, clarity, and long-term growth.

Python 3 is the **current and recommended version** for all modern development.


### Origins & Early Days (Late 1980s–1991)

- **Creator:** Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer.
- **Why Python was created:** Guido was frustrated with existing languages like Perl and shell scripting. He wanted a language that was simple, powerful, and easy to read, inspired by the teaching language **ABC**.
- **Name origin:** Named after the BBC comedy show *Monty Python’s Flying Circus*, not the snake.
- **First release:** Released in early **1991**, featuring support for classes, core data types, and exception handling.

# Why Learn Python?

Python is beginner-friendly but powerful enough for professionals.

## People choose Python because:

- It’s easy to learn

- It’s widely used in the industry

- It has thousands of libraries

- It helps you build real projects quickly
---

# Features of Python

Python is popular because it comes with many built-in features that make programming easier:

- **Easy to Learn and Read:** Python syntax is simple and looks like English.  
  Example:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
Readable and does exactly what it says.

- **Interpreted**: Python executes code line by line, so errors are easier to spot.

- **High-Level Language**: Python handles low-level details like memory management, so you can focus on logic and problem-solving.

- **Dynamic Typing**: You don’t need to declare variable types. Python figures them out:

```
   age = 20      # Integer
   name = "Alex" # String
```

- **Extensive Libraries**: Thousands of built-in modules and third-party libraries for math, web, AI, data science, and more.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Raspberry Pi.
- **Community Support**: A large, active community provides tutorials, help, and resources.

# Installation & Setup
Before we start coding in Python, we need to install it and set up an environment to run our programs.

## Installing Python

- Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

- Download the latest version for your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux).

- **Run the installer**:

Important (Windows only): Check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” before clicking Install.

Wait for the installation to complete.

## Checking Python Version
After installing, make sure Python is installed correctly:
- **Open the terminal** (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).
Type:
```
python --version
```
- You should see the Python version installed, e.g., Python 3.12.0.

 ## Running Python (Terminal vs IDE)

There are **two ways** to run Python code:

**1. Using the Python Shell (Interactive Mode)**
-Open terminal and type python or python3.
-You’ll see >>> which is the interactive prompt.
-Example:
```
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```
**2. Using Scripts (Files)**
-Write your Python code in a file with .py extension, e.g., hello.py.
- Run it in terminal:
```
python hello.py
```
- This is the standard way to work on bigger projects.


## Setting Up VS Code 

 VS Code is a lightweight, beginner-friendly code editor.
- Download VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Install it.
- Install the Python Extension inside VS Code:
- Open VS Code → Extensions → Search “Python” → Install.
- Open a folder for your Python projects and create .py files to start coding. eg. index.py
-You can run code directly in VS Code using the “Run” button or the integrated terminal.

### 💡 Tip:
For beginners, start with VS Code. It’s easier to manage files, see errors, and later work on bigger projects.

# Python Basics
These are the building blocks of Python. You’ll start seeing results immediately while learning the basic concepts.

## Python Shell vs Scripts 

**Python Shell (Interactive Mode)**
Lets you type and run Python code line by line.
Useful for testing small pieces of code.
- Example:
```
>>> 2 + 3
5
>>> print("Hello World!")
Hello World!
```

## Python Scripts (File Mode)

Programs saved in a file with .py extension.

Run the entire program at once using the terminal:
```
python my_script.py

```
---
# Creating a Python File:
- Open Visual Studio Code.
- Create a new file and save it with a .py extension, e.g., hello.py.
- In Python file, we write code to perfrom tasks.
- **💡 Tip:** For beginners, always save your scripts in a separate folder for projects to keep them organized.
---
# Comments Single & Multi-line
Comments are lines in your code that Python ignores. They are used to explain what the code is doing. Comments are for humans, not for the computer.

**Why Comments Matter:**
- Make code easier to understand
- Help others read your code
- Help you remember what your code does later

**Single-line Comment**
```python
# This is a single-line comment
```
**Inline Comment**
```python
print("Hello")  # This prints a message on the screen
```
**Multi-line Comment**
```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It is useful for writing longer explanations.
"""
```
## Notes / Tips:
- Use comments to explain why something is done, not just what is done.
- Too many comments can be noisy, but no comments makes code hard to read.
- Python does not have official multi-line comments. Triple quotes are often used for explanations or documentation.

---
# The print() Function
The print() function is used to display output on the screen. It’s the simplest way to see the results of your code and is often the first function beginners learn in Python.
## **Example / Use Case:**
- Display text messages.
- Show numbers or calculations.
```python
# Printing simple text
print("Hello World!")  #output : Hello World!

# Printing numbers
print(5)               #output : 5
print(2 + 6)           #output : 8

# Printing multiple values
print("Hello", "World")  # outputs: Hello World
```
# Variables
- A variable is used to store data in a program. This data can be a number, text, or any other value that you want to reuse later.
- Think of a variable as a label attached to a value.

**Why Variables Are Needed:**
- To store information
- To reuse values instead of repeating them
- To make programs dynamic and flexible
```python
name = "Python"
age = 10
price = 99.99
```
**Here:**
- name stores text (string)
- age stores a whole number (integer)
- price stores a decimal number (float)
  
 **We will discuss string, integer,float,etc in future.             [Click Here](#built-in-data-types)**

**Using Variables with print()**
```python
name = "Python"
print(name)

age = 10
print(age)
```

**Output:**
```python
Python
10
```

# Naming Rules & Conventions
Naming rules define how variables should be named in Python. These rules make sure Python understands your code and that it remains readable for humans.

**Why Naming Rules Matter:**
- Prevent syntax errors
- Make code easier to read
- Help others understand your code quickly

**Rules for Naming Variables:**
- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores (_)
- A variable name must not start with a number
- Variable names cannot be Python keywords---> **(e.g : print, input, if, else,etc cannot be used as variable name.)**
- Variable names are case-sensitive ---> **(Case sensitive means the Python recognizes the difference between capital and lowercase letters.)**

**Valid Variable Names**
```python
user_name = "Alex"
age = 20
_total = 100
user1 = "Sam"
```
**Invalid Variable Names**
```python
1user = "Alex"      # starts with a number
user-name = "Sam"   # hyphen is not allowed
class = "Math"      # keyword
```
**Case Sensitivity Example**
```python
name = "Alex"
Name = "Sam"

print(name)
print(Name)
```
- These are treated as different variables.

**Naming Conventions (Best Practice):**
- Use snake_case for variable names
```python
total_marks = 450
user_age = 21
```

- Use clear and meaningful names
```python
score = 95      # good
s = 95          # not recommended
```
**Notes / Tips:**
- Avoid single-letter variable names unless in loops (later topic).
- Good names reduce the need for comments.
- Follow consistency throughout your code
---
# Keywords
Keywords are reserved words in Python that have a special meaning. Python uses them to define its own syntax and structure. Because of this, keywords **cannot be used as variable names**.

**Why Keywords Matter:**
- They form the building blocks of Python programs
- They are used for conditions, loops, functions, and more
- Using them incorrectly will cause errors

**Python Keywords:**
![Python Keywords](images/Python_keywords-1024x485.jpg)

**Checking All Keywords in Python**
```python
import keyword
print(keyword.kwlist)
```
**Notes / Tips:**
- You do not need to memorize all keywords.
- You’ll learn them naturally as you write more code.
- If Python shows an error while naming a variable, check if it’s a keyword.
